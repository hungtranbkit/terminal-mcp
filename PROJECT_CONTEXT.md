## Verified current state — 2026-09-28

Terminal MCP durable queue submission is retired for normal coding work.

### Operational workflow
- Normal coding dispatch is direct: `create_session` -> `send` / `send_wait`.
- Do not use `terminal_turn(action="start")`, `enqueue_task`, `route_start`, `agent_start`, `project_start`, aliases such as `run` / `dispatch` / `enqueue`, or `send(long_task=true)`.
- Queue/task history and cleanup remain available so historical or already-running tasks can be inspected/cancelled safely.
- Finished task sessions/worktrees/branches should be cleaned up after verification and merge.

### Queue disable implementation
- `terminal_mcp/queue_policy.py` is the shared fail-closed policy.
- Queue-producing compact actions are blocked in `terminal_mcp/compact_tools.py`.
- Native MCP submit/route/manual-dispatch entrypoints are guarded in `terminal_mcp/mcp_app.py`.
- Default failure code: `QUEUE_DISABLED_USE_DIRECT_SESSION`.
- Only a server operator can deliberately re-enable legacy submission with `TERMINAL_MCP_ENABLE_QUEUE=1`; client arguments cannot enable it.
- Queue DB/schema/engine are intentionally retained for historical tasks and compatibility tests.

### Documentation
- `terminal_mcp/orchestration_policy.py` policy version is 1.2.0 and directs clients to direct session send.
- `docs/CHATGPT_ORCHESTRATION_POLICY.md` is regenerated from that source.
- `terminal_turn` help text now describes direct-session workflow and queue retirement.

### Verification
- Compact/direct/session + queue-policy suite: 138 passed.
- Post-main-sync compact/native/policy/queue suite: 215 passed, 8 deselected.
- Native fail-closed regression proves terminal_enqueue_task and terminal_route_start create no queued row when server opt-in is absent.
- Legacy queue engine tests opt in with `TERMINAL_MCP_ENABLE_QUEUE=1`; only inside tests.

### Live deployment/merge state
- Queue-disable implementation was merged to local `main` and pushed; Terminal MCP HTTP was restarted from `/home/dell/workspace/terminal-mcp`.
- `terminal-mcp-http.service` is active and its unit/environment does not set `TERMINAL_MCP_ENABLE_QUEUE`.
- Live mistaken `terminal_turn(action=start)` returns `QUEUE_DISABLED_USE_DIRECT_SESSION` with `next_action=create_session_then_send`.
- Queue DB row count stayed `21 -> 21` across that rejected live submission, proving no row was persisted.
- The last historical queue record (`memory-knowledge-complete-claude-0928`) became `QUEUED` after restart and was cancelled; active queue records are now `0`. The Memory session itself was not killed.
- Live direct flow was verified with a disposable shell: `create_session` followed by direct `send_wait` returned `DIRECT_OK`; the disposable session was then exited.
- The unrelated root worktree modification `.projectflow/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_STATE.json` was intentionally left untouched.
- Temporary queue-disable branch/worktree/session are removed after this context update is merged; `main` is the canonical code line.

## Planned Paperclip control-plane integration — 2026-09-30

A task epic was added under `docs/paperclip-integration/` to migrate default durable project orchestration to Paperclip while preserving Terminal MCP as a first-class direct ChatGPT execution surface.

### Architectural decision

- Paperclip is the planned owner of durable project/issue lifecycle, default agent assignment, budget/governance, and default isolated coding workspaces.
- Terminal MCP remains independently and directly usable by ChatGPT for low-level execution, inspection, difficult diagnostics, recovery, remote nodes, browser verification, and explicit expert/manual sessions.
- The migration must not make Terminal MCP dependent on Paperclip availability.
- Direct `terminal_turn` access is a compatibility contract, not a temporary migration artifact.
- Legacy durable queue/dispatcher behavior remains retired by default and must not be reintroduced inside the Paperclip adapter.
- Capability retirement is gated: install replacement, prove end-to-end behavior, prove recovery, preserve direct compatibility, then disable only the overlapping orchestration capability.

### Planned task sequence

See `docs/paperclip-integration/TASK_INDEX.md` and `docs/paperclip-integration/README.md`.

The planned slices are TMPC-001 through TMPC-009: public surface cleanup, Paperclip bootstrap, direct ChatGPT contract, native agent pilot, Terminal MCP adapter, deterministic session lifecycle, workspace cutover, hardening/recovery, then final legacy-orchestration retirement.

No Paperclip runtime integration is claimed complete by this planning commit.
